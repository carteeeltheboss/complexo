# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected security vulnerabilities should be reported to me privately, to minimize attacks against current users of complexo before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be investigated and patched on the next patch (or minor) release as soon as possible. This information could be kept entirely internal to the project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability for complexo, please IMMEDIATELY contact hanfaoui212karim@gmail.com to inform the complexo Team.

IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities.
